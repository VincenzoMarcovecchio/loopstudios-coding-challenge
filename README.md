A Frontend Mentor coding challenge I completed not scoring 100% comparing to the design, tablet sizes not that great, messed up with fonts maybe, and couldn't get that hero image to be contained and streched the entire viewport, interesting set up for testing. I'm trying to learn Next.js. I have to go thanks bye
